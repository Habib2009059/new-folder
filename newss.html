          <p class="text">  used while recognising the Tangail Saree as a product of Geographical Indication (GI) for India,<span class="more-text"> alleges Debapriya Bhattacharya, distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). 

            While addressing a discussion on Saturday, he stood firm against the Indian recognition, saying it can never be a GI product of India and Bangladesh should file a lawsuit in this regard in the court of the neighbouring country. 
            
            The CPD organised the programme, titled “Recognition of Tangail Saree as West Bengal’s GI product: Process, Situation and Actions of Bangladesh,” at its office in the capital’s Dhanmondi area.</span></p>

          <p>1st ODI</p>
          <p>Pathum Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan to score an ODI double century, powering the hosts to an
            immense 381 against Afghanistan at Pallekele in their series opener on Friday.

            The opener finished unbeaten on 210 to break the island nation's longstanding record of 189 by Sanath
            Jayasuriya against India in 2000.

            It was also the joint fifth-highest individual score in ODIs.</p>

          <p class="text2">Although research is one of the major responsibilities of a university, a concerning trend of ignoring this
            responsibility persists <span class="more-text2">in some universities across the country.

            Some 15 per cent of private universities, including some old ones, did not have allocations of a single
            penny for research in 2022. A similar situation was found in some newly established public universities.

            Conversely, the prominent universities kept comparatively higher allocations for research, and it is
            reflected in their overall academic performance, according to the University Grants Commission’s (UGC)
            annual report for 2022.</span></p>

          <p>Russian forces are razing the already battered city of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine to the ground and
            sending waves of assault units to overwhelm outgunned Ukrainian troops. After months of brutal fighting, the

            defense impossible.As Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky assumes his role as Ukraine’s top military commander — after a
            broad shake-up of army leadership on Thursday — he could soon be confronted again with the grim calculus
            that has been a feature of the two-year war</p>
